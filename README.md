# Course Codes
As a teaching assistant for the course "Simulation Methods in Statistical Physics" at Fysikum, SU, I developed several codes for multiple projects related to the course. These projects were designed to challenge and enhance the students' understanding of simulation methods in statistical physics. Here is a brief description of each code:

- MC_SI: This code simulates a box containing hundreds of particles using Monte Carlo simulation. The purpose is to study the equilibration of the system and observe how the potential energy of the system changes over time.

- GCMC: This code is an extension of MC_SI and corresponds to the grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation. Here, the box contains hundreds of particles that can exchange with a particle reservoir in contact with the system. This allows the system to achieve chemical equilibrium with the reservoir.

- HSMC: This code simulates a two-dimensional system of hard spheres that interact with each other. The purpose is to study the effects of excluded volume interactions on the system.

- Ising: This code simulates the well-known Ising model, where a two-dimensional array of spins is used to study phase transitions in magnetic materials.

- LR_Ising: This is an extension of the Ising model where spins interact with their nearest neighbors. In this code, the interaction range of the spins can be controlled, allowing the effects of longer-range interactions on phase transitions to be studied.

- XY: This code simulates the XY model for a two-dimensional array of spins that can rotate freely and take any value between 0 and 360 degrees. The purpose is to study the effects of continuous symmetries on phase transitions.

- LR_XY: This code is an extension of the XY model where spins can interact with any number of neighbors. This allows the effects of longer-range interactions on continuous phase transitions to be studied.
